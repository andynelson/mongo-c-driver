mongoc_collection_create_bulk_operation(3)
==========================================


NAME
----
mongoc_collection_create_bulk_operation - begin a new bulk operation


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
-----------------------
mongoc_bulk_operation_t *
mongoc_collection_create_bulk_operation
        (mongoc_collection_t          *collection,
         bool                          ordered,
         const mongoc_write_concern_t *write_concern);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_collection_create_bulk_operation()_ function shall begin a new
bulk operation. After creating this you may call various functions such as
_mongoc_bulk_operation_update()_, _mongoc_bulk_operation_insert()_ and others.
After calling _mongoc_bulk_operation_execute()_, the commands will be executed
in as large as batches as reasonable by the client.

If _ordered_ is true, then processing will stop at the first error.
If _ordered_ is not true, then the bulk operation will attempt to continue
processing even after the first failure.

_write_concern_ should contain the write concern you wish to have applied
to all operations within the bulk operation.


NOTES
-----
In the future, operations may be opportunistically sent to the server as they
are added to the bulk operation, but this has not yet been implemented.


RETURN VALUE
------------
A newly allocated _mongoc_bulk_operation_t_ that should be destroyed with
_mongoc_bulk_operation_destroy()_.


ERRORS
------
get_database and create_bulk_operation are both lazy, and as such do not return any
errors.  get_gridfs ensures relevant indexes, and as such returns errors as
linkmongoc:mongoc_collection_ensure_index[3].
