=========================


NAME
----
mongoc_stream_file_new, mongoc_stream_file_new_for_path - create a new mongoc file stream


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
-----------------------
mongoc_stream_t *mongoc_stream_file_new          (int              fd);
mongoc_stream_t *mongoc_stream_file_new_for_path (const char      *path,
                                                  int              flags,
                                                  int              mode);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_stream_file_new()_ function shall create a new 
linkmongoc:mongoc_stream[7], taking ownership of the file-descriptor _fd_.

fd::
   The file descriptor to take ownership of.
   fd will be closed when the stream is disposed.


The _mongoc_stream_file_new_for_path()_ function shall create a new 
linkmongoc:mongoc_stream[7], using the path, flags and mode provided.
This calls _open()_ and the semantics are the same.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_stream_file_new()_ and _mongoc_stream_file_new_for_path()_
functions return a new linkmongoc:mongoc_stream[7].

If there was a failure to open the file, NULL is returned and errno
is set.


ERRORS
------
errno is set if NULL is returned.
