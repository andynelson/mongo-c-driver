NAME
----
mongoc_gridfs - MongoDB gridfs implementation


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
---------------
mongoc_gridfs_t * gridfs;
bson_t error;

gridfs = mongoc_client_get_gridfs (client, "db", "prefix", &error);
---------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
_mongoc_gridfs_ provides a MongoDB gridfs implementation.  The system as a
whole is made up of _gridfs_ objects, which contain _gridfs_files_ and
_gridfs_file_lists_.  Essentially, a basic file system API.

There are extensive caveats about the kind of use cases gridfs is practical
for.  In particular, any writing after initial file creation is likely to both
break any concurrent readers and be quite expensive.  That said, this
implementation does allow for arbitrary writes to existing gridfs object, just
use them with caution.

_mongoc_gridfs_ also integrates tightly with the linkmongoc:mongoc_stream[7]
abstraction, which provides some convenient wrapping for file creation and
reading/writing.  It can be used without, but its worth looking to see if your
problem can fit that model.


THREAD SAFETY
-------------

_mongoc_gridfs_ is *NOT* thread-safe and should only be used from one thread at
a time. 

LIFECYCLE
---------

Any linkmongoc:mongoc_gridfs_file[7]s or linkmongoc:mongoc_gridfs_file_list[7]s
need to be destroyed before reclaiming the parent gridfs object.  It is a
programming error to do anything besides _destroy()_ these objects if the
parent is gone.

EXAMPLE
-------

The following example demonstrates a trivial gridfs utility capable of reading,
writing and listing files in gridfs.
