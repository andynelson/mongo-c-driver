mongoc_bulk_operation(7)
========================


NAME
----
mongoc_bulk_operation - MongoDB bulk operation abstraction


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
---------------
#include <mongoc.h>

{
   mongoc_bulk_operation_t *bulk;

   bulk = mongoc_collection_create_bulk_operation (collection, true, write_concern);
   /* ... */
   mongoc_bulk_operation_destroy (bulk);
}
---------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
_mongoc_bulk_operation_ provides a convenient API to submit a series of write
operations to MongoDB and look at the result as a cohesive set. If the bulk
operations are performed in _ordered_ mode, then any failure will prevent
future operations from executing. If unordered, they may be performed in
parallel.


LIFECYCLE
---------

It is an error to call linkmongoc:mongoc_bulk_operation_destroy[3] while it has
operations pending.
