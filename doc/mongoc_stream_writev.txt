mongoc_stream_writev(3)
=======================


NAME
----
mongoc_stream_writev - write to a mongoc stream


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
-----------------------
ssize_t
mongoc_stream_writev (mongoc_stream_t *stream,
                      mongoc_iovec_t    *iov,
                      size_t           iovcnt,
                      int32_t          timeout_msec);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_stream_writev()_ function shall perform a write to a
linkmongoc:mongoc_stream[7].  It's modeled on the API and semantics of
linkmongoc:writev[2], though the parameters map only loosely.

iov::
   An array of 'mongoc_iovec_t *'.  These are the same as those used in
   linkmongoc:writev[2].

iovcnt::
   The number of iov's in 'iov'.

timeout_msec::
   The timeout, in milliseconds, to attempt to fully write 'iov'.  If negative,
   use the default timeout.  A timeout of 0 implies a non-blocking write.

All stream implementations implement _writev()_.

RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_stream_writev()_ function returns the number of bytes written on
success and -1 on failure.

ERRORS
------


errno may be set by the underlying transport.

There are also _mongoc_stream_writev()_ specific errors:

ETIMEDOUT::
   'iov' could not be written in 'timeout_msec'.
