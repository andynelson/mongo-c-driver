SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
-----------------------
bool mongoc_collection_validate (mongoc_collection_t *collection,
                                 const bson_t        *options,

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _mongoc_collection_validate()_ function is a helper to validate a MongoDB
collection.

_options_ is an optional bson document containing extra options to pass
to the _validate_ command.

Currently supported options are::

    - if _full_ is true, then a more thorough scan is performed.
    - if _scandata_ is false, then indexes are scanned but not data.

The results are stored in _reply_. _reply_ is initialized even in the case of
failure. Release this with _bson_destroy()_.


RETURN VALUE
------------
true if the command executed successfully.
false if the command failed and _error_ is set.
