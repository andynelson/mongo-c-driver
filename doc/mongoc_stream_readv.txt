mongoc_stream_readv(3)
======================


NAME
----
mongoc_stream_readv - read from a mongoc stream


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
-----------------------
ssize_t
mongoc_stream_readv (mongoc_stream_t *stream,
                     mongoc_iovec_t    *iov,
                     size_t           iovcnt,
                     size_t           min_bytes,
                     int32_t          timeout_msec);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_stream_readv()_ function shall perform a read from a
linkmongoc:mongoc_stream[7].  It's modeled on the API and semantics of
linkmongoc:readv[2], though the parameters map only loosely.

iov::
   An array of 'mongoc_iovec_t *'.  These are the same as those used in
   linkmongoc:readv[2].

iovcnt::
   The number of iov's in 'iov'.

min_bytes::
   The minimum number of bytes to attempt to read.  This performs whatever
   iteration is necessary to gather that many bytes from the underlying
   transport.

timeout_msec::
   The timeout, in milliseconds, to attempt to read 'min_bytes'.  If negative,
   use the default timeout.  A timeout of 0 implies a non-blocking read.

All stream implementations implement _readv()_.

RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_stream_readv()_ function returns the number of bytes read on
success.  It returns >= 0 and < 'min_bytes' when eof is encountered and -1 on
failure.

ERRORS
------

errno may be set by the underlying transport.

There are also _mongoc_stream_readv()_ specific errors:

ETIMEDOUT::
   'min_bytes' could not be read in 'timeout_msec'.
