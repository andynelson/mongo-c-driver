NAME
----
mongoc_stream - MongoDB stream IO abstraction


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
---------------
#include <mongoc.h>

mongoc_stream_t * stream;

stream = mongoc_stream_new(stream_string);
---------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
_mongoc_stream_ provides a generic streaming IO abstraction based on a 'struct
of pointers' interface.  The idea is to allow wrappers, perhaps other language
drivers, to easily shim their IO system on top of mongoc.

The API for the stream abstraction is currently private and non-extensible.

STREAM TYPES
------------

There are a number of built in stream types that come with _mongoc_.  The
default configuration is a buffered unix stream.  If SSL is in use, that in
turn is wrapped in a tls stream.

BUFFERED
~~~~~~~~

A basic buffered stream that minimizes network round trips

GRIDFS
~~~~~~

An abstraction on top of the linkmongoc:mongoc_gridfs[7].

TLS
~~~

OpenSSL based TLS support with x509 certificate verification.

The TLS stream type has a few non-standard methods that involve negotiating the
SSL handshake and cert verification.

UNIX
~~~~

The bread and butter stream type.  This can correlate to a unix domain socket
or a tcp socket.
