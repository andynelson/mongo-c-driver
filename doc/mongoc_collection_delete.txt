bool
mongoc_collection_delete (mongoc_collection_t          *collection,
                          mongoc_delete_flags_t         flags,
                          const bson_t                 *selector,
                          const mongoc_write_concern_t *write_concern,

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_collection_delete()_ function shall delete documents in the given
'collection' that match 'selector'.  The bson 'selector' is not validated,
simply passed along as appropriate to the server.  As such, compatibility and
errors should be validated in the appropriate server documentation.

If you want to limit deletes to a single document, provide
MONGOC_DELETE_SINGLE_REMOVE in 'flags'

'flags' are the same as in linkmongoc:mongoc_collection_find[3].
'selector' is the same as in linkmongoc:mongoc_collection_find[3].

RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_collection_delete()_ function returns true if successful

ERRORS
------
errors are returned through 'error'
