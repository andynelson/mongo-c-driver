NAME
----
mongoc_client_set_stream_initiator - Set the stream initiator for a given client


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
--------------------
void mongoc_client_set_stream_initiator (
   mongoc_client_t          *client,
   mongoc_stream_initiator_t initiator,
   void                     *user_data);

typedef mongoc_stream_t *(*mongoc_stream_initiator_t) (
   const mongoc_uri_t       *uri,
   const mongoc_host_list_t *host,
   void                     *user_data,
   bson_error_t             *error);

typedef struct
{
   char                host[HOST_NAME_MAX + 1];

--------------------

mongoc_client_set_stream_initiator::
   Function definition for setting the stream initiator

mongoc_stream_initiator_t::
   Type of the stream initiator

mongoc_host_list_t::
   Type of the host param in the stream initiator

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_client_set_stream_initiator()_ function shall associate a given
linkmongoc:mongoc_client[7] with a new stream initiator.  This will completely
replace the default transport (buffered TCP, possibly with TLS).  The
'initiator' should fulfill the linkmongoc:mongoc_stream[7] contract.
'user_data' is passed through to the 'initiator' callback and may be used for
whatever run time customization is necessary.


STREAM_INITIATOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

uri::
   the uri initially used in the creation of the parent
   linkmongoc:mongoc_client[7].  It can be used to check for options passed in
   the uri string, but it's probably best to stash those in 'user_data' when
   possible.

error::
   an out parameter, meant for lifting error conditions to whatever call site
   initiated the ultimately failed connect attempt.

host::
   the host to connect to.  See the host subsection for more on what
   information is available.


HOST
~~~~

host::
port::
host_and_port::
   These members are self explanatory, holding represenations of the host and
   port passed in via the uri.

family::
   The family in this case refers to the 'domain' parameter as it is
   conventionally passed to 'socket(2)'.  Currently only the AF_INET and AF_UNIX
   family types are supported.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_client_set_stream_initiator()_ function has no return value.


ERRORS
------
No errors are defined.


LIFE CYCLE
----------
This callback is invoked every time the client needs a stream to a given
'host'.  That means that the 'user_data' passed to the callback needs to remain
valid for potential reconnects as well as the initial connect, and thus for the
life time of the client.
