mongoc_stream_read(3)
=====================


NAME
----
mongoc_stream_read - read from a mongoc stream


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
-----------------------
ssize_t
mongoc_stream_read (mongoc_stream_t *stream,
                    void            *buf,
                    size_t           count,
                    size_t           min_bytes,
                    bson_int32_t     timeout_msec);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_stream_read()_ function shall perform a read from a
linkmongoc:mongoc_stream[7].  It's modeled on the API and semantics of
linkmongoc:read[2], though the parameters map only loosely.

buf::
   A buffer of at least 'count' bytes that is safe to write to.

count::
   The size of the buffer 'buf'

min_bytes::
   The minimum number of bytes to attempt to read.  This performs whatever
   iteration is necessary to gather that many bytes from the underlying
   transport.

timeout_msec::
   The timeout, in milliseconds, to attempt to read 'min_bytes'.  If negative,
   use the default timeout.  A timeout of 0 implies a non-blocking read.

All stream implementations implement _read()_.

RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_stream_read()_ function returns the number of bytes read on
success.  It returns >= 0 and < 'min_bytes' when eof is encountered and -1 on
failure.

ERRORS
------

errno may be set by the underlying transport.

There are also _mongoc_stream_read()_ specific errors:

ETIMEDOUT::
   'min_bytes' could not be read in 'timeout_msec'.
