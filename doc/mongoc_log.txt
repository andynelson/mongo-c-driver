NAME
----
mongoc_log - Log a message in the mongoc log framework


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
-----------------------
void mongoc_log (mongoc_log_level_t  log_level,
                 const char         *log_domain,
                 const char         *format,
                 ...);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_log()_ function shall log a message to the mongoc log framework.

It is a printf style function, accepting a:

log_level::
   The log level to log at.  This correlates to the degree of verbosity
   expected before the log is surfaced.

log_domain::
   A namspace for the log message.  This allows for easy isolation of subsystem
   logging.

format::
   A printf style format string

...::
   variadic printf style arguments

LOG LEVELS
~~~~~~~~~~

There are a variety of supported log levels within the mongoc framework and each
level is inclusive of those below it, I.e. WARNING includes CRITICAL and ERROR.
The mongoc driver delivers these diagnostics through internal calls to
_mongoc_log()_.  In turn, these messages may be consumed in whatever
application appropriate way through setting
linkmongoc:mongoc_log_set_handler[3].

.LEVELS
MONGOC_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR::
   Major API errors.  These are fatal and represent unrecoverable states.
   
MONGOC_LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL::
   Critical errors.  The driver can countinue operation, but may be in a
   degraded mode.

MONGOC_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING::
   Regular warnings.  These don't require immediate attention, but probably
   warrant semi-regular review.
   
MONGOC_LOG_LEVEL_MESSAGE::
   System messages, these include high level state transitions.

MONGOC_LOG_LEVEL_INFO::
   Arbitrary application level information.

MONGOC_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG::
   Debugging information.  You probably don't want this unless you're actively
   debugging.

MONGOC_LOG_LEVEL_TRACE::
   Tracing that includes information such as function entry and exit.

RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_log()_ function has no return value.

ERRORS
------
No errors are defined.
