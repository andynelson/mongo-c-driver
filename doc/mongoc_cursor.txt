NAME
----
mongoc_cursor - MongoDB cursor connection abstraction


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
---------------
const bson_t *doc;
mongoc_cursor_t * cursor;

cursor = mongoc_collection_find (collection,
                                 MONGOC_QUERY_NONE,
                                 0,
                                 0,
                                 &query,
                                 NULL,  /* Fields, NULL for all. */
                                 NULL); /* Read Prefs, NULL for default */

while (mongoc_cursor_next (cursor, &doc)) {
   do_something(doc);
}

DESCRIPTION
-----------
_mongoc_cursor_ provides access to a MongoDB query cursor.  It wraps up the
wire protocol negotation required to initiate a query and retreive an unknown
number of documents.

Cursors are lazy, meaning that no network traffic occurs until the first
linkmongoc:mongoc_cursor_next[3].

At that point we can:

* Determine which host we've connected to with
  linkmongoc:mongoc_cursor_get_host[3].
* Retreive more records with repeated calls to linkmongoc:mongoc_cursor_next[3]
* Test for more records with linkmongoc:mongoc_cursor_more[3]
* Clone a query to repeat execution at a later point with
  linkmongoc:mongoc_cursor_clone[3]
* Test for errors with linkmongoc:mongoc_cursor_error[3]


THREAD SAFETY
-------------

_mongoc_cursor_ is *NOT* thread-safe and should only be used from one thread at
a time. 

LIFECYCLE
---------

The bson objects set in linkmongoc:mongoc_cursor_next[3] are ephemeral and good
until the next call.  linkmongoc:mongoc_cursor_destroy[3] must be called to
clean up, even in the case of exhausted cursors.

EXAMPLE
-------

The following example connects to a single MongoDB instance and performs a
simple query against it. The resulting documents are printed as 'JSON' to
standard output.
