mongoc_init(3)
==============


NAME
----
mongoc_init - Initialize mongoc


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
-----------------------
void
mongoc_init(void);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_init()_ function shall initialize the mongoc library.  While much
of mongoc library functionality is available without _monogc_init()_, some
functions require global initialization and use this hook as the opportunity to
run their initialization code.

It is a programming error not to call this function before use of any dependent
subsytems.  Those functions will _assert()_ in the absence of proper
initialization.

The _mongoc_init()_ function is *NOT* thread-safe.  It should be called early
and in a single threaded environment.  Ideally as one of the first activities
in _main()_.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_init()_ function has no return value.

ERRORS
------
No errors are defined.
