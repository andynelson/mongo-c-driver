mongoc_init(3)
==============


NAME
----
mongoc_init, mongoc_cleanup - Initialize and cleanup libmongoc-1.0.


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
-----------------------
void mongoc_init    (void);
void mongoc_cleanup (void);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_init()_ function shall initialize the mongoc library.  While much
of mongoc library functionality is available without _monogc_init()_, some
functions require global initialization and use this hook as the opportunity to
run their initialization code. On Windows, this calls _WSAStartup()_.

It is a programming error not to call this function before use of any dependent
subsytems.  Those functions will _assert()_ in the absence of proper
initialization.

The _mongoc_init()_ function is *NOT* thread-safe.  It should be called early
and in a single threaded environment.  Ideally as one of the first activities
in _main()_.


_mongoc_cleanup()_ should only be called after all code paths using
libmongoc-1.0 have completed executing. If you are using libmongoc through
_dlopen()_ facilities, you should do this before calling dlclose().
On Windows, this calls _WSACleanup()_.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_init()_ function has no return value.

ERRORS
------
No errors are defined.
