mongoc_read_prefs_t * read_prefs;

read_prefs = mongoc_read_prefs_new (MONGOC_READ_PRIMARY);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
_mongoc_read_prefs_ provides an abstraction on top of the MongoDB connection
read prefences.  It allows for hinting to the driver which nodes in a replica
set should be accessed first.

You can specify a read preference mode on connection objects, database objects,
collection objects, or per-operation.  Generally, it makes the most sense to
stick with *READ_PRIMARY*.  All of the other modes come with caveats that won't
be covered in great detail here.

READ MODES
----------

MONGOC_READ_PRIMARY::
   Default mode. All operations read from the current replica set primary.

MONGOC_READ_SECONDARY::
   In most situations, operations read from the primary but if it is
   unavailable, operations read from secondary members.

MONGOC_READ_PRIMARY_PREFERRED::
   All operations read from the secondary members of the replica set.

MONGOC_READ_SECONDARY_PREFERRED::
   In most situations, operations read from secondary members but if no
   secondary members are available, operations read from the primary.

MONGOC_READ_NEAREST::
   Operations read from the nearest member of the replica set, irrespective of
   the memberâ€™s type.

TAG SETS
--------

Tag sets allow you to specify custom read preferences and write concerns so
that your application can target operations to specific members.

Custom read preferences and write concerns evaluate tags sets in different
ways: read preferences consider the value of a tag when selecting a member to
read from. while write concerns ignore the value of a tag to when selecting a
member except to consider whether or not the value is unique.

You can specify tag sets with the following read preference modes:

* primaryPreferred
* secondary
* secondaryPreferred
* nearest

Tags are not compatible with primary and, in general, only apply when selecting
a secondary member of a set for a read operation. However, the nearest read
mode, when combined with a tag set will select the nearest member that matches
the specified tag set, which may be a primary or secondary.

All interfaces use the same member selection logic to choose the member to
which to direct read operations, basing the choice on read preference mode and
tag sets.
