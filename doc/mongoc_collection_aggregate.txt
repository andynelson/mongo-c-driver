mongoc_collection_aggregate(3)
==============================


NAME
----
mongoc_collection_aggregate - Execute an 'aggregation' query


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
-----------------------
mongoc_cursor_t *
mongoc_collection_aggregate (mongoc_collection_t       *collection,
                             mongoc_query_flags_t       flags,
                             const bson_t              *pipeline,
                             const mongoc_read_prefs_t *read_prefs)
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mongoc_collection_aggregate()_ function shall execute an aggregation query
on the underlying 'collection'.  The bson 'pipeline' is not validated, simply
passed along as appropriate to the server.  As such, compatibility and errors
should be validated in the appropriate server documentation.

In the case of older server versions, < v2.5, the returned cursor is a
synthetic iterator over the result set.  This provides a limitation insofar as
returned documents can be no larger than 16MB.  When connecting to newer
servers this limitation doesn't exist.  The specific test is for wire_version >
0.

'flags' are the same as in linkmongoc:mongoc_collection_find[3].

RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_collection_aggregate()_ function returns a new
linkmongoc:mongoc_cursor[7] if successful.  It returns NULL in the event of
failure.

ERRORS
------
errors are detected through active use of the linkmongoc:mongoc_cursor[7].
