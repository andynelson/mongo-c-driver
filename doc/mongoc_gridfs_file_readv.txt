NAME
----
mongoc_gridfs_file_readv - readv() for gridfs files


SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,c]
------------------------
ssize_t
mongoc_gridfs_file_readv (mongoc_gridfs_file_t *file,
                          mongoc_iovec_t         *iov,
                          size_t                iovcnt,
                          size_t                min_bytes,
                          uint32_t              timeout_msec);

ssize_t

                           mongoc_iovec_t         *iov,
                           size_t                iovcnt,

DESCRIPTION
-----------

mongoc_gridfs_file_readv()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _mongoc_gridfs_file_readv()_ function fulfills the interface in
linkmongoc:mongoc_stream_readv[3] and mimics linkmongoc:readv[2].

iov::
   an array of io vectors to read into

iovcnt::
   The size of 'iov'

min_bytes::
   The minimum number of bytes to read.  Blocks and reads until that many bytes
   are read, eof or a timeout.

timeout_msec::
   The number of milliseconds to attempt to read 'min_bytes' before returning
   -1 and setting errno = ETIMEDOUT

mongoc_gridfs_file_writev()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _mongoc_gridfs_file_writev()_ function fulfills the interface in
linkmongoc:mongoc_stream_writev[3] and mimics linkmongoc:writev[2].

iov::
   an array of io vectors to write into

iovcnt::
   The size of 'iov'

timeout_msec::
   The number of milliseconds to attempt to write 'min_bytes' before returning
   -1 and setting errno = ETIMEDOUT

RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mongoc_gridfs_file_readv()_ and _mongoc_gridfs_file_writev()_ functions
return the number of bytes read on success.  If the return is less than
min_bytes, eof was encountered.  If the return is less than 0 an error was
encountered and errno should be set.


ERRORS
------
ETIMEDOUT::
   The read or write could not be satisfied in the time available
