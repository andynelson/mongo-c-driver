About
=====

Libmongoc is a client library written in C for MongoDB.

There are absolutely no guarantees of API/ABI stability at this point.
But generally, we won't break API/ABI unless we have good reason.

Libmongoc depends on `Libbson <https://github.com/mongodb/libbson>`_.

If you are looking for the legacy C driver, it can be found in the
`legacy branch <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/tree/legacy>`_.
