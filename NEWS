Libmongoc 0.90.0
================

This is the initial release of the new Libmongoc. We chose 0.90.0 for the
release version to differentiate ourselves from the, now legacy, version of
libmongoc. We will rapidly work towards reaching an API/ABI stable library fit
for a 1.0.0 release.

Libmongoc is Apache licensed so it can be embedded in a multitude of scenarios.

The API of 0.90.0 is completely different from the previous versions. We think
this allowed us to create a high-quality library that you will enjoy using in
your applications.

Many outstanding bugs were closed in the process of creating Libbson 0.90.0. So
if you had a pet issue, please take a look to see if it was resolved as part of
this effort!

Thanks, and enjoy developing your applications with libmongoc!
